## Welcome to my homepage!

Hi, there! Here is Ning Dai. I'm now a senior undergraduate student in the Department of Computer Science at **Fudan University** and also an undergraduate research assistant at **FudanNLP** Group (working with [Prof. Xipeng Qiu](https://xpqiu.github.io/en.html){:target="_blank"} and [Prof. Xuanjing Huang](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=RGsMgZA4H78C&hl=en){:target="_blank"}).  





## Research Interests

Generally, I'm doing research on **Natural Language Processing** and **Machine Learning**. So far, I have explored a lot of topics in NLP and ML, such as Reinforcement Learning, Dependency Parsing, Text Generation and Semantic Parsing, etc. Specifically, here are the topics that I'm recently interested in:

- Unsupervised Sequence-to-Sequence Learning 

  (e.g. Unsupervised Machine Translation, Unpaired Text Style Transfer)

- Learning Natural Language in an Interactive Environment 

  (e.g. Text Game)

- Natural Language Visual Grounding 

  (e.g. Vision-and-Language Navigation)
