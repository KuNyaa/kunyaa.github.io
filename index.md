## Welcome to my homepage!

Hi, there! Here is Ning Dai. I'm now a first-year PhD student in the School of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science at **Oregon State University** (advised by [Prof. Liang Huang](https://web.engr.oregonstate.edu/~huanlian/){:target="_blank"}). 

Previously, I was an undergraduate research assistant at **FudanNLP** Group (advised by [Prof. Xipeng Qiu](https://xpqiu.github.io/en.html){:target="_blank"}).  





## Research Interests

Generally, I'm doing research on **Natural Language Processing** and **Machine Learning**. So far, I have explored a lot of topics in NLP and ML, such as Reinforcement Learning, Dependency Parsing, Text Generation and Self-supervised Representation Learning, etc. Specifically, here are the topics that I'm recently interested in:

- Multilingual Representation Learning

  (e.g. Probing/Understanding Multilingual Pre-training Models)

- Unsupervised Sequence-to-Sequence Learning 

  (e.g. Unsupervised Machine Translation, Unpaired Text Style Transfer)

- Semantic Parsing and Program Synthesis

  (e.g. Code Generation)
